# Detecting Hoax News Indonesian Society using Binarized Na√Øve Bayes
The Naive Bayes (NB) Binary Model measures the fraction of each class of documents that contains terms, whereas the Naive Bayes standard measures the fraction of tokens or the position in each class of documents that contain words (terms). When classifying new documents, the NB binary model uses binary information, which means that it produces indicator 1 for each term in the vocabulary of training documents or indicator 0, which indicates there are no terms in the training documents. The NB binary model ignores the number of occurrences or the number of repeated words that occur, whereas the Naive Bayes standard counts the number of equal words occurring.
